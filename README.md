 
Quoting Dojo Redux 

App that allows users to add quotes to a database and display them on a separate page.

The 'add my quote' button should add the user's quote to the database, but the 'skip to quotes' button should take the user directly to the main page.  

Use the following URLs for your project:

GET ' / ' Shows a form to post quotes and name 
POST '/quotes' for the method of the form to make a new quote.
GET '/quotes' where all the quotes are rendered.
